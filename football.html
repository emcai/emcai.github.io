						<b> 2018 Week 3 Excitement Ratings Top 5: </b>

					<p> <b> This Week's Notes: </b> <br>
						Boise St vs Oklahoma St is ranked so high because S&P+ has both teams in the top 11 teams in FBS while projecing the game to be very close as well. My personal games to watch are LSU vs Auburn and Ohio St vs TCU. The only reason LSU vs Auburn is not ranked highly in excitement is because Vegas doesn't give LSU much of a chance with the double-digit spread. OSU is even more heavily favored, so that game is ranked at lowly 13th in excitement.

					<p>
						I provide excitement ratings for each game between a Power 5 team and any FBS team, as well as any game between a top 25 team and any FBS team. <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						My predictions account for many factors to rate excitement, including predicted scoring margin, offensive ratings, and quality of teams in game.
					</p>
					<p>
						I aim to publish excitement ratings for the next week of football every Thursday evening.

						2018 Week 2 Excitement Ratings Top 5:
					</p>
					<center><img src="2018E2Top.png"></img></center>
					<p> NOTE: Interestingly, a ranked matchup between 3. Georgia and 24. South Carolina was ranked 12th in excitement. This is probably because the model thinks the Gamecocks are overrated and will be solidly beaten by the Bulldogs. Also, College Gameday's matchup between 2. Clemson and Texas A&M is ranked 14th in excitment for similar reasons - the model thinks the Aggies have no real shot at beating Clemson. My model expects 2-touchdown wins for both Georgia and Clemson.

					<p>
						I provide excitement ratings for each game between a Power 5 team and any FBS team, as well as any game between a top 25 team and any FBS team. <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						My predictions account for many factors to rate excitement, including predicted scoring margin, offensive ratings, and quality of teams in game.
					</p>
					<p>
						I aim to publish excitement ratings for the next week of football every Thursday evening.

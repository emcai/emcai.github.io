						Week 11 Predictions for College Football Excitement, 2017 Season:
					</p>
					<img src="ExcitementW11.png"></img>
					<p>
						I provide excitement ratings for each game between two "strong" Power 5 teams, as well as any game between a top 25 team and a "strong team". <br>
						My definition of a "strong" team is a team that is within one game of being .500
					</p>
					<p>
						My predictions account for many factors to rate excitement, including predicted scoring margin, offensive ratings, and quality of teams in game. The exact formula is a secret.
					</p>
					<p>
						I aim to publish excitement ratings for the next week of football every Thursday evening.

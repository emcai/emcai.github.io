# Eddie's Investment Strategy

Disclaimer: **This is not financial advice**. This page is meant to share my personal decisions when making investment decisions regarding stocks and bonds.

Note that there are other valid investment paths that I do not personally use for investment purposes - these include bank accounts, US (or other government) treasury notes, gold, real estate, etc.
**This page will only focus on purchasing stocks (or more specifically index funds) and bonds**.

#### Why Do I Pick These Funds?

I pick the collection of funds listed on this document for a few major reasons. The largest reason is diversification. I select fund categories with very diverse holdings / asset classes.
This gives us several advantages: the largest advantage is it lowers risk. We invest in several different funds which are attempted to have low correlation: if one of them goes down significantly, 
our goal is to have our other holdings go down less significantly. Since investing is risky, anything we can do to decrease this risk is favorable for investing purposes. Also, we get exposed
to several different categories, so that if one of them suddenly gets huge returns, we get to profit from a piece of that.

## Investment Strategy

In my opinion there are two basic steps to determining investment allocation before making any purchases: Total investment amount and stock/bonds distribution.
For each section of stocks and bonds, I will provide several examples of fund tickers: One each for Vanguard, Fidelity, and one other example.
There should be no meaningful difference between any of the examples in the same category. Simply pick one based on what your brokerage offers.

#### Investment Amounts

The first decision for any investor is to determine how much money you are willing to invest. This decision is different for everyone and is based on how much you are willing to lose.
I would recommend only investing money you feel comfortable losing. There are inherent risks that **you may lose a significant proportion of your investment**.

#### Asset Class Distribution

Before making any decisions of individual funds to invest in, it is important to determine what percentage of stocks, and bonds to purchase.
This generally comes with how much risk you're willing to take. A higher percentage of stocks will come with higher risk, but with higher expected returns.
That is, on average in the long-term, you can expect stocks to profit more than bonds. But stocks on average will also lose money more significantly during down years than bonds.

As a rule of thumb, people who are closer to retirement will want to take less risks and therefore have a higher proportion of bonds to stocks.
This is once again a personal decision, but I subscribe to the (110 - age)% rule for stock percentage. i.e. the proportion of your investments in stocks is = 110 - (current age).

Example: A 30-year-old following this rule would invest in (110-30) = 80% stocks (and therefore 20% bonds). A 55-year-old would invest in (110-55) = 55% stocks (and therefore 45% bonds).

## Stock Strategy

A general tip for funds is to check their expense ratios. Several niche funds have slightly higher expense ratios (up to 0.25-0.3%). Lower expenses are obviously better for investing!

#### Easiest/Simplest Option

The easiest / simplest option to invest is to put all of your money allocated for stocks in a low-cost total-market index fund.
These funds are very similar to the S&P 500 (82% similarity for Vanguard) but include mid-size and smaller companies too, while the S&P 500 only includes large companies.
Compared to the S&P 500, a total-market index fund can expect to generate slightly higher returns while taking on slightly higher risk.

If you only want to invest in one fund, do this one. A low-cost total-market index fund can be the backbone of any investment portfolio.

Example funds: Vanguard: **VTI**, Fidelity: **FSKAX**, Other: **ITOT**

#### International Funds

A total-market fund seems very diverse, but it has one downfall: it only captures the US markets. To help fix this, we can add in an international low-cost total-market index fund to our portfolio.
This will give us increased diversity, given that world markets are not always correlated with one another. Personally, I allocate 30% of my stock allocation into an international fund.

Example funds: Vanguard: **VXUS**, Fidelity: **FTIHX**, Other: **IXUS**

#### Small-Cap and Value Stocks

In investment theory, two types of stocks that outperform the market over the long-term are small-cap and value stocks. These stocks go up and down similarly to the market as a whole, however generally
in a more volatile fashion. Therefore, adding these two types of stocks will increase your expected returns, at the cost of increasing the volatility / risk of your investments. I recommend adding 
a small amount of these stocks to increase the upside of your portfolio. Thankfully, most brokerages have recently started to offer a small-cap value ETF, so we can invest in both of these factors 
by purchasing one fund.

Example funds: Vanguard: **VBR**, Fidelity: **FISVX**, Other: **ISCV**

#### REITs

REITs (Real-Estate Investment Trusts) allow investors to passively invest in the US real-estate market, without having to actively manage tenants or perform maintenance on real estate properties. 
Investing in a REIT can increase diversity in a portfolio, since real estate prices and profits are often not correlated strongly with the stock market as a whole. Therefore, REITs are a great 
option for increasing diversity, while capturing profits from a non-stock or bond related market.

Example funds: Vanguard: **VNQ**, Fidelity: **FSRNX**, Other: **USRT**

## Bond Strategy

#### Simplest Option

The simplest strategy for investing in bonds is very similar to the one for stocks - purchasing a low-cost total-market bond index fund. There are several studies which show that the type of bonds 
and the specific bond funds you invest in is far less impactful on a portfolio than the decision of how much to invest in bonds. Therefore I recommend a simple bond strategy - all funds in a total-market
bond fund.

Example funds: Vanguard: **BND**, Fidelity: **FTBFX** (or several other good Fidelity bond funds), Other: **AGG**

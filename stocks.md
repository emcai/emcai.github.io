# Eddie's Investment Strategy

Disclaimer: **This is not financial advice**. This page is meant to share my personal decisions when making investment decisions regarding stocks and bonds.

Note that there are other valid investment paths that I do not personally use for investment purposes - these include bank accounts, US (or other government) treasury notes, gold, real estate, etc.
**This page will only focus on purchasing stocks (or more specifically index funds) and bonds**.

## Investment Strategy

In my opinion there are two basic steps to determining investment allocation before making any purchases: Total investment amount and stock/bonds distribution.
For each section of stocks and bonds, I will provide several examples of fund tickers: One each for Vanguard, Fidelity, and one other example.
There should be no meaningful difference between any of the examples in the same category. Simply pick one based on what your brokerage offers.

#### Investment Amounts

The first decision for any investor is to determine how much money you are willing to invest. This decision is different for everyone and is based on how much you are willing to lose.
I would recommend only investing money you feel comfortable losing. There are inherent risks that **you may lose a significant proportion of your investment**.

#### Asset Class Distribution

Before making any decisions of individual funds to invest in, it is important to determine what percentage of stocks, and bonds to purchase.
This generally comes with how much risk you're willing to take. A higher percentage of stocks will come with higher risk, but with higher expected returns.
That is, on average in the long-term, you can expect stocks to profit more than bonds. But stocks on average will also lose money more significantly during down years than bonds.

As a rule of thumb, people who are closer to retirement will want to take less risks and therefore have a higher proportion of bonds to stocks.
This is once again a personal decision, but I subscribe to the (110 - age)% rule for stock percentage. i.e. the proportion of your investments in stocks is = 110 - (current age).

Example: A 30-year-old following this rule would invest in (110-30) = 80% stocks (and therefore 20% bonds). A 55-year-old would invest in (110-55) = 55% stocks (and therefore 45% bonds).

## Stock Strategy

A general tip for funds is to check their expense ratios. Several niche funds have slightly higher expense ratios (up to 0.25-0.3%). Lower expenses are obviously better for investing!

#### Easiest/Simplest Option

The easiest / simplest option to invest is to put all of your money allocated for stocks in a low-cost total-market index fund.
These funds are very similar to the S&P 500 (82% similarity for Vanguard) but include mid-size and smaller companies too, while the S&P 500 only includes large companies.
Compared to the S&P 500, a total-market index fund can expect to generate slightly higher returns while taking on slightly higher risk.

If you only want to invest in one fund, do this one. A low-cost total-market index fund can be the backbone of any investment portfolio.

Exmaple funds: Vanguard: **VTI**, Fidelity: **FSKAX**, Other: **ITOT**
